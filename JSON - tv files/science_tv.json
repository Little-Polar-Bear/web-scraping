Now that gritty approach to crime known as forensic science makes its way from Las Vegas to the streets of Florida in CSI: Miami. A whole new team of crime scene investigators is on hand to probe the seamy underside of what some refer to as Cuba North and others call Georgia South.

Now, she's interrogating witnesses whose lives and circumstances have since changed, making use of today's new science and finding fresh clues to solve cases that were previously unsolvable, all of which appeals to this smart, driven detective. She's also prepared for the consequences: that her work will open up old wounds and may lead suspects to commit new crimes. When she hits a dead-end, Lilly seeks advice from her respected mentor, Lt. John Stillman (John Finn, Catch Me If You Can). Also on the team are Det. Scotty Valens (Danny Pino, The Shield), Rush's confident and strong-willed partner; Det. Will Jeffries (Thom Barry, The Fast and the Furious), who's been around long enough to serve as Lilly's link to the past; and Det.
