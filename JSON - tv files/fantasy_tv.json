The series was Chris Carter's much anticipated follow-up to the very popular The X-Files. Millennium focused on the work of ex-FBI profiler Frank Black, who had retired but was brought back in as a consultant. Frank had a special ability to see into the minds of serial killers and to get into their heads. He also worked for a mysterious organization called the Millennium Group which seemed to take a special interest in serial killers and end of the world prophecy. In the first season, Frank lived in Seattle with his wife Catherine and daughter Jordan. The show focused on Frank's work as a profiler. He spent most of his time in the first season trying to solve serial murder cases. During the second season, the show primarily on Frank's relationship with the Millennium Group. He separated from his wife after his violent rescue of her from a stalker. Frank learned that the Millennium Group was a secret society that believed that the world was coming to an end. During that season, Frank spent much of his time working with Millennium Group member Peter Watts and fellow investigator Laura Means.\n\nAfter the death of his wife at the end of the second season, Frank severed all connection with the Millennium Group and returned to work with the FBI. With the help of special agent Emma Hollis, he began to investigate the Millennium Group itself. The show changes direction again this season, however much of the long term questions that were raised during the first two seasons are answered. The show was canceled at the end of the third season, with an unfinished ending. In later 1999, the show received a conclusion of sorts in a crossover with The X-files entitled \"Millennium.\" However very little closure is brought by this episode. There is however as of late rumors that Millennium may be brought back as a movie of some kind in the near future and finish the story. Show Type: Mystery/Thriller/Horror\n\nAs of late, there has been some speculation in 2008 about the possibility of a \"Millennium Movie\" however, it is not know how likely this is yet.
