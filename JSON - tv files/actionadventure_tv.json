Benito Martinez (Outbreak & Her Costly Affair) plays \"Captain David Aceveda,\" the young precinct head who doesn't like Mackey's tactics and wants to bust him off the force. And the Emmy-nominated CCH Pounder (ER & Boycott), plays \"Det. Claudette Wyms,\" a veteran detective who understands Mackey and knows how to play both sides of the fence.\n\nThe show made history by becoming the first ad-supported cable series to win the 2003 Golden Globe Award for Best Drama Series. In its first season, Shawn Ryan (Writing) and Clark Johnson (Directing) received Emmy nominations, which were also firsts for basic cable in those categories.
