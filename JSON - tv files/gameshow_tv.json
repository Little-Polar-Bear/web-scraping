In each episode, the losing team is sent to the boardroom, where Trump and his associates, Carolyn Kepcher and George Ross, and later, his children, Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump, judge the job applicants on their performance in the task.  One person is fired and sent home.  Who will succeed?  Who will fail?  And who will be The Apprentice?\n\nThe ninth season of The Apprentice is the third celebrity edition.  Fourteen celebrities will compete for the title of the third Celebrity Apprentice and the grand prize of $250,000 for the charity of the choice.  The season is already rife with big personalities and lots of drama, and though it's early, many tough competitors have emerged.\n\nThe eighth season of The Apprentice was yet another celebrity edition.  Sixteen celebrities competed for the title of the second Celebrity Apprentice and the grand prize of $250,000 for the charity of their choice.  The cast was more interesting than the previous batch of celebrities, and the drama was a lot more intense.  However, Trump started making less credible decisions in his firings, and the episodes were soon more about the drama among the celebrities than it was about the actual tasks.  In the end, comedienne Joan Rivers faced off against professional poker player Annie Duke in the show's second all-female final two, and despite the majority opinion that Duke's performance throughout the season had been better overall, Trump ended the season on a sour note with the controversial decision to name Rivers as the second Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nThe seventh season of The Apprentice saw the show returning to New York City.  And this time, instead of real people being the candidates, celebrities were.  Fourteen celebrities vied for the title of the first-ever Celebrity Apprentice, including a returning Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth from the first season.  Among the changes were both teams facing the boardroom following the task to hear what each team did right and wrong, in case that team ended up in the boardroom.  The season certainly wasn't without its share of drama, and it showed some pretty smart celebrity candidates.  In the end, America's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan and country singer Trace Adkins faced off in the final two, and Morgan took the title of first-ever Celebrity Apprentice, taking $250,000 for the charity of his choice along with him.\n\nThe sixth season of The Apprentice saw the show leave New York City and move to an all-new location: Los Angeles, California!  Here, Carolyn Kepcher and George Ross were gone and replaced as viceroys by Donald Trump's children, Donald, Jr., and Ivanka.  While the candidates, among whom were the show's first Asian-American man, the first Jamaican woman, a cervical cancer survivor, and not one, but two openly gay men, were interesting, the season pulled the show's lowest ratings ever, with too much focus on Trump and his brands, as well as Los Angeles pop culture, and not enough on the candidates and the tasks.  Also, Trump's logic behind his firing decisions made less and less sense.  In the end, Stefani Schaeffer, James Sun, Nicole D'Ambrosio, and Frank Lombardi all faced off in the show's first-ever final four finale that saw Stefani and James ending up as the final two, and Stefani walking away as the sixth Apprentice (and the second female Apprentice, to boot).\n\nThe fifth season of The Apprentice started with something new: the first Project Managers were chosen by Trump, and they got to pick their own teams.  Also, exemptions were wiped clean from the rules.  The season started out with promise, with four international candidates from Canada, Cuba, Great Britain, and Russia, but lost steam as the more interesting, colorful candidates, including three of the four international ones, quickly bit the dust and were fired earlier than the blander, less interesting ones.  The show ended up with what's been considered to be its worst final two ever, and in the end, the final international candidate, Sean Yazbeck, claimed victory over Lee Bienstock, the youngest candidate to ever make it to the final two, and won the title of the fifth Apprentice, as well as the honor of being the first winner to not be a native-born American.\n\nThe fourth season of The Apprentice returned to the basics -- the same men vs. women format and winning Project Managers winning exemption -- but this time, with a twist.  The winning Project Managers would only receive exemption from Trump if the team cast a majority vote to okay it.  The season, which featured the first-ever openly gay contestant and first-ever Russian immigrant, easily shaped up to be one of the best seasons of the show, with an interesting cast, exciting tasks, and even the show's first-ever quadruple-firing!  In the end, Dr. Randal Pinkett faced off with Rebecca Jarvis in the final two and won his rightful title as the fourth Apprentice and the first African-American winner.  However, the finale was marred by his refusing Trump's offer to hire Rebecca, as well, in what would've been the show's first double-hiring.\n\nThe third season of The Apprentice included a new twist: there are already two preset teams, \"Book Smarts\" and \"Street Smarts\" (Magna Corporation and Net Worth Corporation, respectively). They went head-to-head to see which team was smarter. In the end, the question was answered in the showdown of the century -- Kendra Todd, a college graduate, faced off against Tana Goertz, a high school graduate, in the show's first all-female final two.  While in the end, the Book Smarts won the battle, as Kendra was given the grand prize and the title of the third Apprentice (and the first female Apprentice, to boot), the experiment of season three showed that both groups of people can be very successful.\n\nThe second season of The Apprentice pitted men and women against each other again, but with several changes.  The winning Project Manager, or team leader, received an exemption the next week should his or her team lose the task.  The tasks became tougher, the judging became harder, and the contestants became fiercer.  By the end of the season, Kelly Perdew, though met with tough competition by Jennifer Massey, took his place with Trump on the other side of the boardroom table as the second Apprentice.\n\nThe first, and now classic, season of The Apprentice asked the age-old question: which gender is smarter?  Packed with memorable contestants and mesmerizing moments, the first season was an enormous hit, garnering some of NBC's best ratings in years.  By season's end, Bill Rancic was told, \"You're hired!\" and named the first and original Apprentice over Kwame Jackson, and all of the cast members became instant celebrities, with Donald Trump, as always, at the head of the pack.\n\nNBC Broadcast History\nJanuary 8 & 15, 2004-- Thursday 8:30pm\nJanuary 14 & 28, 2004 through April 14, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (Repeats)\nJanuary 21, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (First Run Episode)\nJanuary 29, 2004 - Present Day -- Thursday 9:00pm\nSeptember 11, 2004 - September 25, 2004 -- Saturday 8:00pm\nOctober 2, 2004 - October 23, 2004 -- Saturday 9:00pm (Repeats)\n\nSpecial Presentations February 5 & 12, 2004 -- Thursday 8:42pm (Special Supersized Episodes)\nApril 17, 2004 -- Saturday 9:00pm (2 Hour Rebroadcast Season 1 Final\u00e9)\nSeptember 9, 2004; January 20, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (1 1/2 Hour Season Premieres)\nSeptember 16, 2004 -- Thursday 9:20pm (Special Supersized Episode 1 Hour & 40 Minutes)\nSeptember 29, 2004 -- Wednesday 9:00pm (Day Early)\nDecember 1, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (Recap Special, Day Early) January 27, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (Special Supersized Episode)\nMarch 24, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (Special Time)\n\nCNBC also airs episodes of The Apprentice on a rotating schedule (when the season is current)\n\nGlobal Broadcast History (Canada)\nJanuary 8 & 15, 2004 -- Thursday 8:30pm\nJanuary 14 & 28, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (Repeats)\nJanuary 21, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (First Run Episode)\nJanuary 29, 2004 - Present Day -- Thursday 9:00pm\nOctober 2, 2004 - October 23, 2004 -- Saturday 9:00pm (Repeats\n\nSpecial Presentations in Canada April 18, 2004 -- Sunday 1:06am (2 Hour Rebroadcast Season 1 Final\u00e9)\nSeptember 9, 2004 -- Thursday 8:30pm (1 1/2 Hour Season 2 Premiere) September 16, 2004 -- Thursday 9:20pm (Special Supersized Episode 1 Hour & 40 Minutes)\nSeptember 29, 2004 -- Wednesday 9:00pm (Day Early)\nDecember 1, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (Recap Special, Day Early)\nJanuary 20, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (1 1/2 Hour Season 3 Premiere)\nJanuary 27, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (Special Supersized Episode)\nMarch 24, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (Special Time)\n\nThe Apprentice  (US Version)in Other Countries:\n\nNew Zealand: 8:35 PM on TV2\nHong Kong: 8.35 PM Saturdays on TVB Pearl\nLatin America:9PM Wednesdays on People+Arts (a BBC-Discovery Channel)\nTurkey: 9PM Thursdays on CNN Turk\nSweden: 10:30 PM Sundays on Kanal 5 United Kingdom: 6 PM Weekdays on BBC-2\nBrazil: 9PM Wednesdays on People+Arts (a BBC-Discovery Channel).

In each episode, the losing team is sent to the boardroom, where Trump and his associates, Carolyn Kepcher and George Ross, and later, his children, Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump, judge the job applicants on their performance in the task.  One person is fired and sent home.  Who will succeed?  Who will fail?  And who will be The Apprentice?\n\nThe ninth season of The Apprentice is the third celebrity edition.  Fourteen celebrities will compete for the title of the third Celebrity Apprentice and the grand prize of $250,000 for the charity of the choice.  The season is already rife with big personalities and lots of drama, and though it's early, many tough competitors have emerged.\n\nThe eighth season of The Apprentice was yet another celebrity edition.  Sixteen celebrities competed for the title of the second Celebrity Apprentice and the grand prize of $250,000 for the charity of their choice.  The cast was more interesting than the previous batch of celebrities, and the drama was a lot more intense.  However, Trump started making less credible decisions in his firings, and the episodes were soon more about the drama among the celebrities than it was about the actual tasks.  In the end, comedienne Joan Rivers faced off against professional poker player Annie Duke in the show's second all-female final two, and despite the majority opinion that Duke's performance throughout the season had been better overall, Trump ended the season on a sour note with the controversial decision to name Rivers as the second Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nThe seventh season of The Apprentice saw the show returning to New York City.  And this time, instead of real people being the candidates, celebrities were.  Fourteen celebrities vied for the title of the first-ever Celebrity Apprentice, including a returning Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth from the first season.  Among the changes were both teams facing the boardroom following the task to hear what each team did right and wrong, in case that team ended up in the boardroom.  The season certainly wasn't without its share of drama, and it showed some pretty smart celebrity candidates.  In the end, America's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan and country singer Trace Adkins faced off in the final two, and Morgan took the title of first-ever Celebrity Apprentice, taking $250,000 for the charity of his choice along with him.\n\nThe sixth season of The Apprentice saw the show leave New York City and move to an all-new location: Los Angeles, California!  Here, Carolyn Kepcher and George Ross were gone and replaced as viceroys by Donald Trump's children, Donald, Jr., and Ivanka.  While the candidates, among whom were the show's first Asian-American man, the first Jamaican woman, a cervical cancer survivor, and not one, but two openly gay men, were interesting, the season pulled the show's lowest ratings ever, with too much focus on Trump and his brands, as well as Los Angeles pop culture, and not enough on the candidates and the tasks.  Also, Trump's logic behind his firing decisions made less and less sense.  In the end, Stefani Schaeffer, James Sun, Nicole D'Ambrosio, and Frank Lombardi all faced off in the show's first-ever final four finale that saw Stefani and James ending up as the final two, and Stefani walking away as the sixth Apprentice (and the second female Apprentice, to boot).\n\nThe fifth season of The Apprentice started with something new: the first Project Managers were chosen by Trump, and they got to pick their own teams.  Also, exemptions were wiped clean from the rules.  The season started out with promise, with four international candidates from Canada, Cuba, Great Britain, and Russia, but lost steam as the more interesting, colorful candidates, including three of the four international ones, quickly bit the dust and were fired earlier than the blander, less interesting ones.  The show ended up with what's been considered to be its worst final two ever, and in the end, the final international candidate, Sean Yazbeck, claimed victory over Lee Bienstock, the youngest candidate to ever make it to the final two, and won the title of the fifth Apprentice, as well as the honor of being the first winner to not be a native-born American.\n\nThe fourth season of The Apprentice returned to the basics -- the same men vs. women format and winning Project Managers winning exemption -- but this time, with a twist.  The winning Project Managers would only receive exemption from Trump if the team cast a majority vote to okay it.  The season, which featured the first-ever openly gay contestant and first-ever Russian immigrant, easily shaped up to be one of the best seasons of the show, with an interesting cast, exciting tasks, and even the show's first-ever quadruple-firing!  In the end, Dr. Randal Pinkett faced off with Rebecca Jarvis in the final two and won his rightful title as the fourth Apprentice and the first African-American winner.  However, the finale was marred by his refusing Trump's offer to hire Rebecca, as well, in what would've been the show's first double-hiring.\n\nThe third season of The Apprentice included a new twist: there are already two preset teams, \"Book Smarts\" and \"Street Smarts\" (Magna Corporation and Net Worth Corporation, respectively). They went head-to-head to see which team was smarter. In the end, the question was answered in the showdown of the century -- Kendra Todd, a college graduate, faced off against Tana Goertz, a high school graduate, in the show's first all-female final two.  While in the end, the Book Smarts won the battle, as Kendra was given the grand prize and the title of the third Apprentice (and the first female Apprentice, to boot), the experiment of season three showed that both groups of people can be very successful.\n\nThe second season of The Apprentice pitted men and women against each other again, but with several changes.  The winning Project Manager, or team leader, received an exemption the next week should his or her team lose the task.  The tasks became tougher, the judging became harder, and the contestants became fiercer.  By the end of the season, Kelly Perdew, though met with tough competition by Jennifer Massey, took his place with Trump on the other side of the boardroom table as the second Apprentice.\n\nThe first, and now classic, season of The Apprentice asked the age-old question: which gender is smarter?  Packed with memorable contestants and mesmerizing moments, the first season was an enormous hit, garnering some of NBC's best ratings in years.  By season's end, Bill Rancic was told, \"You're hired!\" and named the first and original Apprentice over Kwame Jackson, and all of the cast members became instant celebrities, with Donald Trump, as always, at the head of the pack.\n\nNBC Broadcast History\nJanuary 8 & 15, 2004-- Thursday 8:30pm\nJanuary 14 & 28, 2004 through April 14, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (Repeats)\nJanuary 21, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (First Run Episode)\nJanuary 29, 2004 - Present Day -- Thursday 9:00pm\nSeptember 11, 2004 - September 25, 2004 -- Saturday 8:00pm\nOctober 2, 2004 - October 23, 2004 -- Saturday 9:00pm (Repeats)\n\nSpecial Presentations February 5 & 12, 2004 -- Thursday 8:42pm (Special Supersized Episodes)\nApril 17, 2004 -- Saturday 9:00pm (2 Hour Rebroadcast Season 1 Final\u00e9)\nSeptember 9, 2004; January 20, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (1 1/2 Hour Season Premieres)\nSeptember 16, 2004 -- Thursday 9:20pm (Special Supersized Episode 1 Hour & 40 Minutes)\nSeptember 29, 2004 -- Wednesday 9:00pm (Day Early)\nDecember 1, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (Recap Special, Day Early) January 27, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (Special Supersized Episode)\nMarch 24, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (Special Time)\n\nCNBC also airs episodes of The Apprentice on a rotating schedule (when the season is current)\n\nGlobal Broadcast History (Canada)\nJanuary 8 & 15, 2004 -- Thursday 8:30pm\nJanuary 14 & 28, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (Repeats)\nJanuary 21, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (First Run Episode)\nJanuary 29, 2004 - Present Day -- Thursday 9:00pm\nOctober 2, 2004 - October 23, 2004 -- Saturday 9:00pm (Repeats\n\nSpecial Presentations in Canada April 18, 2004 -- Sunday 1:06am (2 Hour Rebroadcast Season 1 Final\u00e9)\nSeptember 9, 2004 -- Thursday 8:30pm (1 1/2 Hour Season 2 Premiere) September 16, 2004 -- Thursday 9:20pm (Special Supersized Episode 1 Hour & 40 Minutes)\nSeptember 29, 2004 -- Wednesday 9:00pm (Day Early)\nDecember 1, 2004 -- Wednesday 8:00pm (Recap Special, Day Early)\nJanuary 20, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (1 1/2 Hour Season 3 Premiere)\nJanuary 27, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (Special Supersized Episode)\nMarch 24, 2005 -- Thursday 8:30pm (Special Time)\n\nThe Apprentice  (US Version)in Other Countries:\n\nNew Zealand: 8:35 PM on TV2\nHong Kong: 8.35 PM Saturdays on TVB Pearl\nLatin America:9PM Wednesdays on People+Arts (a BBC-Discovery Channel)\nTurkey: 9PM Thursdays on CNN Turk\nSweden: 10:30 PM Sundays on Kanal 5 United Kingdom: 6 PM Weekdays on BBC-2\nBrazil: 9PM Wednesdays on People+Arts (a BBC-Discovery Channel).
