Klaus Landsberg worked in the sound department on \"Home Improvement\".\n\n\u2022Colleges and universities in Michigan sent star 'Allen, Tim' sweaters and T-shirts to wear on the air, and he did.\n\n\u2022The name Binford Tools, the company that sponsor's the Tool Time show, is named after an anthropologist who made several new discoveries regarding stone age and tools.\n\n\u2022There is a running gag regarding the Taylor's neighbor, Wilson; his face is always concealed from about the nose down. In most episodes, Wilson was being shot from behind a fence, but in later episodes where he got out more often, camera shots, actor movements, and prop placements were carefully orchestrated so that his full face was not revealed. In fact, during all the curtain calls for the show (except the series finale curtain call, where his entire face was shown), actor Earl Hindman, who played Wilson, would bring a miniature picket fence to hold in front of his face so that it would remain hidden from view.\n\n\u2022The character Wilson is based on Tim Allen's childhood memories where he was too short to see over a fence, and was therefore unable to see his neighbor.\n\n\u2022Originally, actress Frances Fisher was cast as Jill Taylor but was replaced with Patricia Richardson 4 days before the pilot episode was taped.\n\n\u2022Richard Karn's wife, Tudi Roche, would occasionally make appearances on the show as Jill's sister Carrie.\n\n\u2022The full names of the older two Taylor boys were Bradley Michael Taylor and Randall William Taylor. (Mark's full name isn't mentioned during the series.)\n\n\u2022The label \"WLS\" was frequently used to cover up real corporate logos. WLS is the Chicago affiliate of ABC.\n\n\u2022While meeting with Bud Harper, Tim is told \"...Heidi tested better than Santa Claus.\" Tim Allen played Santa Claus in Santa Clause, The (1994).\n\n\u2022As a running gag, whenever Tim enters the basement, he always bangs his head on a large pipe hanging overhead.\n\n\u2022The character 'Tim Taylor' was ranked #20 in TV Guide's list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\" (20 June 2004 issue).\n\nAwards and Nominations \u2022Won the 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997, 1996, 1995, 1994, 1993, and 1992 ASCAP Award for Top TV Series (Dan Foliart)\n\n\u2022Won the 1999, 1998 and 1997 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Comedy Series (Donald A.

Klaus Landsberg worked in the sound department on \"Home Improvement\".\n\n\u2022Colleges and universities in Michigan sent star 'Allen, Tim' sweaters and T-shirts to wear on the air, and he did.\n\n\u2022The name Binford Tools, the company that sponsor's the Tool Time show, is named after an anthropologist who made several new discoveries regarding stone age and tools.\n\n\u2022There is a running gag regarding the Taylor's neighbor, Wilson; his face is always concealed from about the nose down. In most episodes, Wilson was being shot from behind a fence, but in later episodes where he got out more often, camera shots, actor movements, and prop placements were carefully orchestrated so that his full face was not revealed. In fact, during all the curtain calls for the show (except the series finale curtain call, where his entire face was shown), actor Earl Hindman, who played Wilson, would bring a miniature picket fence to hold in front of his face so that it would remain hidden from view.\n\n\u2022The character Wilson is based on Tim Allen's childhood memories where he was too short to see over a fence, and was therefore unable to see his neighbor.\n\n\u2022Originally, actress Frances Fisher was cast as Jill Taylor but was replaced with Patricia Richardson 4 days before the pilot episode was taped.\n\n\u2022Richard Karn's wife, Tudi Roche, would occasionally make appearances on the show as Jill's sister Carrie.\n\n\u2022The full names of the older two Taylor boys were Bradley Michael Taylor and Randall William Taylor. (Mark's full name isn't mentioned during the series.)\n\n\u2022The label \"WLS\" was frequently used to cover up real corporate logos. WLS is the Chicago affiliate of ABC.\n\n\u2022While meeting with Bud Harper, Tim is told \"...Heidi tested better than Santa Claus.\" Tim Allen played Santa Claus in Santa Clause, The (1994).\n\n\u2022As a running gag, whenever Tim enters the basement, he always bangs his head on a large pipe hanging overhead.\n\n\u2022The character 'Tim Taylor' was ranked #20 in TV Guide's list of the \"50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time\" (20 June 2004 issue).\n\nAwards and Nominations \u2022Won the 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997, 1996, 1995, 1994, 1993, and 1992 ASCAP Award for Top TV Series (Dan Foliart)\n\n\u2022Won the 1999, 1998 and 1997 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Comedy Series (Donald A.
