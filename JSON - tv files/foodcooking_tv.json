Each of these chefs dreams of fame and fortune, but many soon find their dreams becoming nightmares. Chef Ramsay demands quality and the intensity of the challenges is beyond anything the contestants can ever imagine. Split into two teams, they must compete against each other to provide their very best in the kitchen. If they do, they are lavishly rewarded with everything from extravagant trips to a ride on Ramsay's personal yacht. Those that fail are forced to suffer humiliating punishment.\n\nAt the end of each episode, the chef who provided the best performance in Ramsay's opinion on the losing team is chosen to select two chefs from their own team for elimination. They must then give their reasons for their selection. Though one of these two chefs may be eliminated, Ramsay is under no obligation to choose either, and the final decision as to who is sent home is made solely by him.\n\nFrom Waffle House chefs to executive chefs, the competitors are tested in every way possible, from leadership skills to culinary skills. Traditional challenges include a taste-test of everyone's palette and special events such as birthdays and weddings. The chefs, however, must always be on their toes, as they never know when surprises may be coming.\n\nWatch now for the sixth season of the program, now airing every Tuesday night at 8 P.M. on FOX!\n\nPrevious season - Hell's Kitchen aired the fifth season at 9 P.M. on Thursdays In this, the fifth season, contestants competed for the position of head chef at a restaurant in the Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa-- one being built specifically for the winner. This season's crop featured what executive producer Kent Weed promised to be \"the best chefs we've ever assembled,\" with everything from a cooking-school instructor to a food-court chicken fryer. There were many contenders, but many dramatic twists as well.\n\nYou can catch repeats of various seasons of the program on FOX Reality, which has the rights to repeats of the show.\n\nTheme Tune - \"Fire\" by the Ohio Players\n\nThe first season of Hell's Kitchen is now available in stores across the United States on DVD.
