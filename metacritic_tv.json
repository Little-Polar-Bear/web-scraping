					"title": "Beavis and Butt-head: Season 1",
					"description": "Beavis and Butt-head was first aired on the U.S. cable network MTV in March 1993. This show, which combined animation and music videos, was an example of the unique programming that MTV has consistently provided for its youthful demographics. The half-hour program alternated between a simple narrative, which focused on the exploits of two low-life adolescents, and clips from music videos, which the two teens commented on. Creator Mike Judge had penned the aimless duo for a festival of animation when Abby Turkuhle, MTV's senior vice president picked up an episode for the network's animated compendium Liquid Television. MTV immediately contracted for 65 episodes from Judge, with Turkuhle as producer, and placed Beavis and Butt-head in the 7:00 and 11:00 P.M. week-day time slots.\n\nThe characters, Beavis and Butt-head, are rude, crude, and stupid, and can be placed in the \"dumb comedy\" tradition, which includes Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Cheech and Chong, Saturday Night Live's Wayne and Garth, and FOX's The Simpsons. When the show debuted, television critics differed in their opinions, with some praising the show for daring to present the stupidity of male \"metalheads\" who watch too much television (effectively satirizing the core MTV audience), and others categorizing Beavis and Butt-head as another example of television's declining quality. Beavis and Butt-head did find an audience and began pulling in MTV's highest ratings. But the show was also quite controversial, instigating heated public debate on the interconnected issues of representations of violence in the media and generational politics surrounding youth subcultures.\n\nBeavis and Butt-head they found, was especially popular with those in their twenties. It turned out to be bothersome to many that young people enjoyed the show and laughed at its two imbecilic boys, even if these fans were much more intelligent and much less grating than Beavis and Butt-head. In this sense, Beavis and Butt-head raised the issue of generational taste cultures. Definitions of \"taste,\" Pierre Bourdieu notes, \"unite and separate, uniting those who are the product of similar conditions but only by distinguishing them from all others. And taste distinguishes in an essential way, since it is the basis of all that one has--people and things--and of all that one is for others, whereby one classifies oneself and is classified by others.\" To the degree that taste cultures agree, they are brought together into a subcultural formation; but to this degree they are also separated from those with whom they differ. It was the \"bad taste\" of Beavis and Butt-head's audience which bothered many, and this brings to the surface another one of the reasons why Beavis and Butt-head was so controversial.\n\nCultural critics, educators, and concerned parents gathered skeptically, sternly, and anxiously in front of the television set and passed judgment upon the \"tasteless\" Beavis and Butt-head show. And in an ironic reversal, Beavis and Butt-head countered by ascending the cultural hierarchy. The two youths channel-surfed, looking for videos that didn't suck (i.e. those with heavy metal or hardcore rap, those that contained violence, or encouraged genital response.) In becoming the self-proclaimed Siskel and Ebert of music video, they served to evaluate pop culture with an unencumbered bottom line--does a music video \"suck\" or is it \"cool?\" Beavis and Butt-head as a television show, was certainly towards the lower end of traditional scales of cultural \"quality.\" But these two animated \"slackers\" evaluated other media, and so pronounced their own critical opinions and erected their own taste hierarchies. Beavis and Butt-head had their own particular brand of \"taste:\" they determined acceptability and unacceptability, invoking, while simultaneously upending, notions of \"high\" and \"low\" culture. In this, they entered that hallowed sphere of criticism, where they competed with others in overseeing the public good and preserving the place and status of artistic evaluation. They disregarded other accepted forms of authority, refusing to acknowledge their own limited perspectives. But like other critics, this was an important part of their appeal. After all, critics are sought out for straightforward opinion, not muddled oscillation.\n\nIn this recuperation of the critical discourse, Beavis and Butt-head joined with their audience, approximating the contradictory impulses of contemporary cynical youth, who mixed their self-delusion with self-awareness. In the case of fans of Beavis and Butt-head, these lines of demarcation indicated both a generational unity and the generation-based barriers between the baby boomers and the \"baby busters.\" The reputed cynicism of the \"twentynothings\" was on view as Beavis and Butt-head evoked both a stunted adolescence which was long past and an unsure and seemingly inaccessible future.",

					"description": "Murphy Brown was created by Diane English. Murphy is the star reporter on a news magazine show called FYI. The show is based in Washington DC, which gives the FYI team more than enough material to work with. Murphy lives in a townhouse that she has been having repainted for the duration of the series, Eldin the painter may never finish the job, but Murphy doesn't seem to mind. Murphy owes her Betty Ford trip to Phil, he owns the local bar & restaurant where the staff and the rest of the political scene have lunch. Phil knows about everything going on in Washington. Jim Dial is the uptight senior anchor, a seasoned veteran, who accompanied Murphy on her trip to the Betty Ford Clinic. Frank is a single guy and constantly looking for a girlfriend, he is also Murphy's best friend. Corky is a former Miss America turned news person, she covers all the \"hard\" news. Miles is a young Harvard graduate, whose first \"real job\" out of school is as executive producer of FYI. \n\nMurphy has trouble keeping a secretary, in this guide the actors that play this small part has their appearance number placed after their names, take note of the increasing number after the character name of Secretary. Some secretaries had no dialog and did not get credited, others wound up on the cutting room floor, this accounts for holes in the numbering scheme. When Murphy became a new mother, she began to run through nannies the same way, they are also numbered after the character name of Nanny. After running through 6 of them, she makes the obvious choice for a nanny, Eldin, who prefers the term \"Big Guy.\" It also takes Murphy four months to give the baby his name. \n\nAfter nine seasons in the newsroom, the series looked like it might take a different direction in the 10th season. Murphy may change careers and become a White House senior advisor. Amazing since in the past she had been banned from the White House press room on several occassions. True to form, when she does, it is only for a short time. When a commercial for the series aired during the 49th Annual Prime Time Emmy Awards, it seemed to indicate that Murphy's life would take a different turn. It certainly does when she faces her own mortality when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. \n\nMurphy Brown has done well with the Prime Time Emmy Awards with nominations in many categories and numerous awards for Candice Bergen as \"Best Actress in a Comedy Series.\" So many in fact that she declined the nomination for 1996, allowing Helen Hunt to get the Emmy that Candice thought she deserved a few years earlier.\n\nFirst air date: November 14, 1988\nLast air date: May 18, 1998\nOriginal air time: Monday 9:00:00 pm (Eastern)\n\nEpisodes: 247 Color Episodes + 1 Special\n\nNielsen Ratings:\n(Top 30 or Better)\n#27 in the 1989–1990 Season\n#6 in the 1990–1991 Season\n#3 in the 1991–1992 Season\n#4 in the 1992–1993 Season\n#9 in the 1993–1994 Season\n#16 in the 1994–1995 Season\n#20 in the 1995–1996 Season",

					"description": "Each half-hour episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm features verité-style footage of David (playing himself) at home, at work and around town, as he gets into predicaments with fictional and real-life personalities. With cast regulars Jeff Garlin (as manager Jeff Greene) and Cheryl Hines (as wife Cheryl), the series features appearances by guest celebrities playing themselves or character roles. Candid, unsparing and self-deprecating, Curb Your Enthusiasm brings the off-kilter comic vision of Larry David--co-creator and co-executive producer of one of the most lauded comedy series in TV history, Seinfeld--to HBO. The series blurs the lines between reality and fiction, as David (playing himself) and a cast of real and fictional characters are followed around Los Angeles by a ubiquitous camera that chronicles the private, often banal world of a (relatively) public man. Having evolved from the 1999 HBO special Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, this series proves how seemingly trivial details of one's day-to-day life--a trip to the movies, a phone call, a visit from some trick-or-treaters--can precipitate a \"Murphy's Law\" chain of misfortune to hilarious effect. Like George Costanza in Seinfeld, the protagonist of Curb Your Enthusiasm has a knack for getting himself into uncomfortable situations that end up alienating him from peers and acquaintances. To keep the narrative fresh and spontaneous, Curb Your Enthusiasm is shot without a script; the cast is given scene outlines and often improvise lines as they go. The result is an unpredictable format that's unlike anything else on TV.\nIn Germany the show is known as Lass es, Larry! (\"Stop it, Larry!\")In Portuguese the show is known as A Louca Vida de Larry (\"Larry's Crazy Life\")In Norway it is known is Ingen grunn til begeistringIn Sweden it is known as Simma lugnt, Larry!In Finland it is known as JÃ¤itÃ¤ hattuun",

Since the beginning, the series has been a pop culture icon, attracting hundreds of celebrities to guest star. The show has also made name for itself in its fearless satirical take on politics, media and American life in general.\n\nCurrently in its 21st season, The Simpsons has piled up over 440 episodes, over 20 Emmy Awards, a handful of music albums, countless endorsements and merchandise, and even made the jump to the silver screen in the summer of 2007 with The Simpsons Movie.

While George Sr. spent the last year in the slammer discovering his newfound Judaism and recording inspirational tapes, Michael spent it picking up the pieces and trying to teach his offbeat family how to live without an endless expense account.  All the while, Michael has also been trying to do right by his 14-year-old son, GEORGE MICHAEL (Michael Cera), an earnest kid who works diligently at the family’s frozen banana stand. \n\nThe Bluths are led by manipulative matriarch LUCILLE BLUTH (Jessica Walter), a socialite who is as icy as her martinis.  Then there’s the oldest son, GOB (Will Arnett), a womanizer and struggling magician (sorry, “illusionist”) whose biggest trick will be to make a real job appear.  The youngest brother is BUSTER (Tony Hale), a neurotic professional grad student and glorified mama’s boy (he spent 11 months in the womb). \n\nThe Bluth siblings are rounded out by cause-obsessed sister LINDSAY (Portia de Rossi), who is married to the hapless TOBIAS (David Cross), a doctor-turned-actor who might get more work if he wasn’t a self-proclaimed “never-nude.” Lindsay and Tobias are the ultra-permissive parents of MAEBY (Alia Shawkat), a 14-year-old who loves finding unique ways to rebel against their overindulgence.",

					"description": "Each half-hour episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm features verité-style footage of David (playing himself) at home, at work and around town, as he gets into predicaments with fictional and real-life personalities. With cast regulars Jeff Garlin (as manager Jeff Greene) and Cheryl Hines (as wife Cheryl), the series features appearances by guest celebrities playing themselves or character roles. Candid, unsparing and self-deprecating, Curb Your Enthusiasm brings the off-kilter comic vision of Larry David--co-creator and co-executive producer of one of the most lauded comedy series in TV history, Seinfeld--to HBO. The series blurs the lines between reality and fiction, as David (playing himself) and a cast of real and fictional characters are followed around Los Angeles by a ubiquitous camera that chronicles the private, often banal world of a (relatively) public man. Having evolved from the 1999 HBO special Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, this series proves how seemingly trivial details of one's day-to-day life--a trip to the movies, a phone call, a visit from some trick-or-treaters--can precipitate a \"Murphy's Law\" chain of misfortune to hilarious effect. Like George Costanza in Seinfeld, the protagonist of Curb Your Enthusiasm has a knack for getting himself into uncomfortable situations that end up alienating him from peers and acquaintances. To keep the narrative fresh and spontaneous, Curb Your Enthusiasm is shot without a script; the cast is given scene outlines and often improvise lines as they go. The result is an unpredictable format that's unlike anything else on TV.\nIn Germany the show is known as Lass es, Larry! (\"Stop it, Larry!\")In Portuguese the show is known as A Louca Vida de Larry (\"Larry's Crazy Life\")In Norway it is known is Ingen grunn til begeistringIn Sweden it is known as Simma lugnt, Larry!In Finland it is known as JÃ¤itÃ¤ hattuun",

					"description": "The universal experience of teenagehood as lived by the regular old freaks and geeks in a Michigan high school, circa 1980, is the subject of this wistful comedy-drama executive-produced by Emmy-winner Judd Apatow and series creator Paul Feig. Revolving around the lives of freak and geek siblings Lindsay and Sam Weir (Linda Cardellini, John Daley), the show includes the everyday fears, humiliations and little triumphs of adolescents past, present and, no doubt, future,too. For sophomore Lindsay, life is getting difficult. Jolted by the death of her grandmother, she dons her dad's old Army jacket and fights the one-girl battle of McKinley High. The allure of being a champion \"mathlete\" is losing its appeal, and her goals of college and career feel somehow irrelevant. She's alienated. Luckily, though, she's not really alone. Drifting away from her studious friends, she finds herself increasingly drawn to others like her, the \"freaks\" who ' refuse to accept the status quo. Among them are Daniel (James Franco), a friendly but also a  dangerous guy who seems to like Lindsay, as does his bud Nick (Jason Segel), who dreams of stardom as a rock-and-roll drummer a la Led Zeppelin's Jon Bonham. Then there's Ken (Seth Rogen), an acerbic rebel, and Kim (Busy Philipps), a tough girl who doesn't go easy on Lindsay. Meanwhile, Lindsay's freshman brother Sam navigates high school like a mouse in a maze. Threatened at every turn, and attracted to an unattainable cheerleader, Sam faces his own set of obstacles. But he has good friends. Sure, they're \"geeks,\" but so is Sam. There's Neal (Samm Levine), a wise-acre, sci-fi loving geek, and bespectacled Bill (Martin Starr), a classic looking nerd who's unfortunately not as brainy as he appears. On the homefront, Lindsay and Sam suffer through the good intentions of their overbearing mom (Becky Ann Baker) and their hardwired dad Joe Flaherty), who turns every teen issue into a matter of life and death. Unfortunately the show was canceled after only 12 episodes had aired, this was due to the poor ratings obtained. A fan-led campaign caused NBC to broadcast three more episodes in July 2000, but these would not be seen until September of that year when the cable channel Fox Family aired them in syndication.",

Having evolved from the 1999 HBO special Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, this series proves how seemingly trivial details of one's day-to-day life--a trip to the movies, a phone call, a visit from some trick-or-treaters--can precipitate a \"Murphy's Law\" chain of misfortune to hilarious effect. Like George Costanza in Seinfeld, the protagonist of Curb Your Enthusiasm has a knack for getting himself into uncomfortable situations that end up alienating him from peers and acquaintances. To keep the narrative fresh and spontaneous, Curb Your Enthusiasm is shot without a script; the cast is given scene outlines and often improvise lines as they go. The result is an unpredictable format that's unlike anything else on TV.\nIn Germany the show is known as Lass es, Larry! (\"Stop it, Larry!\")In Portuguese the show is known as A Louca Vida de Larry (\"Larry's Crazy Life\")In Norway it is known is Ingen grunn til begeistringIn Sweden it is known as Simma lugnt, Larry!In Finland it is known as JÃ¤itÃ¤ hattuun",

					"title": "Malcolm in the Middle: Season 1",
					"description": "Created and executive-produced by Emmy Award-winning writer Linwood Boomer, this inventive half-hour series is seen through the eyes of MALCOLM (Frankie Muniz), a regular high school kid trying to navigate his way through life despite the various obstacles thrown in his way – a complete misunderstanding of girls, the constant burden of masterminding plans to get himself and his brothers into or out of trouble, and a miserable job at the Lucky Aide… not to mention a severe case of teen angst.\n\nAlthough Malcolm has a genius IQ, he can't seem to make sense of the opposite sex, much less his embarrassing family. Lois (Jane Kaczmarek) is the outspoken, opinionated mom, who still manages to rule the roost even though her boys are growing wise to her crafty ways. Hal (Bryan Cranston), a dad who is just a bumbling, big kid at heart, often finds himself creating more chaos than his five boys combined. Reese (Justin Berfield) has mastered the art of a perfect blank stare, and makes up for his lack of intelligence with deviance.\n\nFrancis (Christopher Masterson), Malcolm's oldest and favorite brother, is willing to move from Alabama to Alaska to New Mexico – as long as its keeps him from moving back home. Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), no longer the youngest, has learned his tricks from the best and often pulls the wool right over his brothers' eyes. And then there's Jamie, the newest member … and family scapegoat.\n\nTimeslot History on Fox and Global\n\nJanuary  2000 - July 2002 .... Sundays, 8:30pm\nAugust 2002 - October 2004 ....

					"description": "Ed Stevens is a contracts lawyer at a high-profile New York City firm. Around the same time he splits with his wife (who slept with a mailman), he makes a single error in punctuation when going over a contract. Because of the resulting financial loss to the firm, he's fired. Despondent, he heads back to his (small) hometown of Stuckeyville -- 'Anytown', USA. There he realizes he's been missed by a lot of friends whom he's missed and he sees Carol, the girl he'd adored in high school. Swept up in roiling emotions, Ed buys the local bowling alley on a whim, moves to Stuckeyville, and determines to win Carol's heart. His horizons broaden as he settles once more in Stuckeyville, and the series itself settles into a charming, funny, often serious slice-of-life series focused not solely on Ed but on the lovable ensemble cast of people who live and work with him in Stuckeyville.\nTHEME SONG\nThe first season's theme song was Foo Fighters' \"Next Year\" from their There Is Nothing Left To Lose CD. The second season's theme song was Clem Snide's \"Moment In The Sun\" from their The Ghost of Fashion CD. \"Next Year\" was welcomed back as the theme song at the beginning of the third season.\nSYNDICATION\nAs of 2007, the show is not in syndication, but CMT Canada has announced they started airing the show September 8, 2006 at 8pm. It's not believed to be aired in the USA.\nDVDs\nAs of 2008, there are no official DVDs available for the show. Judging from what we've heard, the reason for the delay in getting DVDs to the market is the music rights are expensive. The show used a lot of tracks from a large number of artists, and it would be very expensive for NBC to acquire the rights to use the music on the DVDs.",

					"title": "The Wire: Season 3",
					"description": "In chronicling a multi-generational family business dealing illegal drugs and the efforts of the Baltimore police to curb their trade, this series draws parallels between these organizations and the men and women on either side of the battle.The words of Gary W. Potter, Professor of Criminal Justice and Police Studies at Eastern Kentucky University, in writing about the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s, can also be used to illuminate some of the central premises of the show:\"There is precious little difference between those people who society designates as respectable and law abiding and those people society castigates as hoodlums and thugs. The world of corporate finance and corporate capital is as criminogenic and probably more criminogenic than any poverty-wracked slum neighborhood. The distinctions drawn between business, politics, and organized crime are at best artificial and in reality irrelevant. Rather than being dysfunctions, corporate crime, white-collar crime, organized crime, and political corruption are mainstays of American political-economic life.\"Tim Goodman, the television critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, summed the show up perfectly when he wrote: \"This show is precisely the reason you pay for HBO.\"In New York's Newsday, Diane Werts says: \"Most TV crime series aspire to John Grisham's level. 'The Wire' aspires to Dostoevsky's.\"Season ThemesSeason One centers around a family of drug dealers and the innerworkings of their empire.  It also follows the detectives who are trying to catch the high members of the empire.  Season Two steps away from the drug trade (while still mentioning characters from the previous season) to a case of dead prostitutes which turns into a look at the corruption surrounding the Port.  Season Three investigates politics and finishes the main stories that were left open in season one.  Season Four focuses on four middle school students and their journeys through the public school system and continues to address the politics of an inner-city and the issues of an election.  Season Five is rumored to be about the media's role in Baltimore.  Season Five will be the show's final season.Theme MusicIn the Season One opening credits, the Blind Boys of Alabama did Tom Waits's \"Way Down in the Hole\". The Season Two opening credits feature Waits's version of the song. According to creator David Simon, \"It was our way of saying: This is the same show (song) but this year, the tale itself (singer, tonality) will be different.\" The Neville Brothers's version of the song opens Season Three. The theme which plays over the end credits was composed by the show's music supervisor, Blake Leyh.\n\nInternational AiringsAustralia -- Monday at 12:00 p.m. on Ch.9.

FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper is called in to investigate the murder of this young woman in the small, Northwestern town of Twin Peaks.  What he doesn't know is that in Twin Peaks, no one is innocent.Twin Peaks was created by TV veteran Mark Frost (Hill Street Blues) and edgy filmmaker David Lynch, Academy Award nominated director of The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr.  It aired on ABC from 1990 - 1991. The series, with a few exceptions, followed the interesting convention that one episode equaled one day in the town of Twin Peaks.  This means that after 30 episodes, the series covers just slightly more than one month.After Twin Peaks was canceled by ABC, David Lynch went on to make the prequel film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, the story of the last seven days of  Laura Palmer.",

					"title": "The Wire: Season 2",
					"description": "In chronicling a multi-generational family business dealing illegal drugs and the efforts of the Baltimore police to curb their trade, this series draws parallels between these organizations and the men and women on either side of the battle.The words of Gary W. Potter, Professor of Criminal Justice and Police Studies at Eastern Kentucky University, in writing about the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s, can also be used to illuminate some of the central premises of the show:\"There is precious little difference between those people who society designates as respectable and law abiding and those people society castigates as hoodlums and thugs. The world of corporate finance and corporate capital is as criminogenic and probably more criminogenic than any poverty-wracked slum neighborhood. The distinctions drawn between business, politics, and organized crime are at best artificial and in reality irrelevant. Rather than being dysfunctions, corporate crime, white-collar crime, organized crime, and political corruption are mainstays of American political-economic life.\"Tim Goodman, the television critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, summed the show up perfectly when he wrote: \"This show is precisely the reason you pay for HBO.\"In New York's Newsday, Diane Werts says: \"Most TV crime series aspire to John Grisham's level. 'The Wire' aspires to Dostoevsky's.\"Season ThemesSeason One centers around a family of drug dealers and the innerworkings of their empire.  It also follows the detectives who are trying to catch the high members of the empire.  Season Two steps away from the drug trade (while still mentioning characters from the previous season) to a case of dead prostitutes which turns into a look at the corruption surrounding the Port.  Season Three investigates politics and finishes the main stories that were left open in season one.  Season Four focuses on four middle school students and their journeys through the public school system and continues to address the politics of an inner-city and the issues of an election.  Season Five is rumored to be about the media's role in Baltimore.  Season Five will be the show's final season.Theme MusicIn the Season One opening credits, the Blind Boys of Alabama did Tom Waits's \"Way Down in the Hole\". The Season Two opening credits feature Waits's version of the song. According to creator David Simon, \"It was our way of saying: This is the same show (song) but this year, the tale itself (singer, tonality) will be different.\" The Neville Brothers's version of the song opens Season Three. The theme which plays over the end credits was composed by the show's music supervisor, Blake Leyh.\n\nInternational AiringsAustralia -- Monday at 12:00 p.m. on Ch.9.

					"title": "Homicide: Life on the Street: Season 1",
					"description": "This series was the most reality-based police drama that has ever aired on television.  It was shot entirely with handheld cameras on location in the Fells Point Community of Baltimore, MD.  One of the series' executive producers, Barry Levinson, is a Baltimore native.  He has written and directed at least three films that take place in Baltimore: \"Diner\", \"Tin Men\" & \"Avalon\".  Doing this show was a natural for him.\n\nThe series was based on a book called \"Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets,\" by David Simon, a writer who spent a year with the members of Baltimore's homicide unit.  Some of the series' characters and cases were based on the book.\n\nThis series was unlike most cop shows of that time, in that there were almost no car chases, gunfights and etc.  This show was about closing cases and the act of the crime was usually never seen.  Generally, the viewer first sees the case when the detective(s) arrive on the scene.  Open cases are kept track of on a board, open cases under the primary detective's name are shown in red ink, when the case is closed the red is replaced by black ink.  During the first season it aired, it didn't have great ratings and the chances for a second season looked bleak.  When Steven Bochco's NYPD Blue premiered in the Fall of '93 and got great ratings, police dramas \"were in\" and the series was given the go-ahead for a second season (the two Emmy Awards probably didn't hurt either).  The better ratings of the second season led to a full third and subsequent seasons.  When the Lifetime cable channel picked the show up for syndication in 1997 it helped guarantee that there would be a fifth season.  Then NBC made it possible for the series to have a sixth and seventh season.\n\nWith the great cast, acting, writing, and directing the series has won awards including a few Emmy Awards, Writer's Guild Awards and George Foster Peabody Awards.  Most of these awards were earned by Tom Fontana, one of the series' executive producers, whose other credits include St. Elsewhere.  In the 1995-1996 television season Andre Braugher was finally nominated for Best Actor in a Drama.  While he didn't win that year, two years later in the 1997-1998 television season he was again nominated, this time the Television Academy recognized what we already knew, that Andre Braugher was the best actor working in television drama.\n\nOne of the highlights of the series, starting with the second season was the use of music.  All varieties of music have been featured throughout the series, most often it was featured in a montage of the detectives conducting their investigation.\n\nFirst air date: January 31, 1993\nLast air date: May 21, 1999\nOriginal air time: Friday 10:00:00 pm (Eastern)",

It plays out in a tough, morally ambiguous world in which the line between good and bad is crossed every day. The series focuses on the tension between a group of corrupt but effective cops and a captain torn between bringing them down and advancing his own political ambitions. The Shield stars Michael Chiklis (The Commish) as rogue cop \"Det. Vic Mackey,\" leader of the elite Strike Team unit, who is effective at eliminating crime but who operates under his own set of rules. Benito Martinez (Outbreak & Her Costly Affair) plays \"Captain David Aceveda,\" the young precinct head who doesn't like Mackey's tactics and wants to bust him off the force. And the Emmy-nominated CCH Pounder (ER & Boycott), plays \"Det. Claudette Wyms,\" a veteran detective who understands Mackey and knows how to play both sides of the fence.\n\nThe show made history by becoming the first ad-supported cable series to win the 2003 Golden Globe Award for Best Drama Series. In its first season, Shawn Ryan (Writing) and Clark Johnson (Directing) received Emmy nominations, which were also firsts for basic cable in those categories. The Shield has received two TCA nominations for Outstanding Achievement in Drama.  As of March 2005, the show has become the longest running series on the FX Network.",

					"description": "The universal experience of teenagehood as lived by the regular old freaks and geeks in a Michigan high school, circa 1980, is the subject of this wistful comedy-drama executive-produced by Emmy-winner Judd Apatow and series creator Paul Feig. Revolving around the lives of freak and geek siblings Lindsay and Sam Weir (Linda Cardellini, John Daley), the show includes the everyday fears, humiliations and little triumphs of adolescents past, present and, no doubt, future,too. For sophomore Lindsay, life is getting difficult. Jolted by the death of her grandmother, she dons her dad's old Army jacket and fights the one-girl battle of McKinley High. The allure of being a champion \"mathlete\" is losing its appeal, and her goals of college and career feel somehow irrelevant. She's alienated. Luckily, though, she's not really alone. Drifting away from her studious friends, she finds herself increasingly drawn to others like her, the \"freaks\" who ' refuse to accept the status quo. Among them are Daniel (James Franco), a friendly but also a  dangerous guy who seems to like Lindsay, as does his bud Nick (Jason Segel), who dreams of stardom as a rock-and-roll drummer a la Led Zeppelin's Jon Bonham. Then there's Ken (Seth Rogen), an acerbic rebel, and Kim (Busy Philipps), a tough girl who doesn't go easy on Lindsay. Meanwhile, Lindsay's freshman brother Sam navigates high school like a mouse in a maze. Threatened at every turn, and attracted to an unattainable cheerleader, Sam faces his own set of obstacles. But he has good friends. Sure, they're \"geeks,\" but so is Sam. There's Neal (Samm Levine), a wise-acre, sci-fi loving geek, and bespectacled Bill (Martin Starr), a classic looking nerd who's unfortunately not as brainy as he appears. On the homefront, Lindsay and Sam suffer through the good intentions of their overbearing mom (Becky Ann Baker) and their hardwired dad Joe Flaherty), who turns every teen issue into a matter of life and death. Unfortunately the show was canceled after only 12 episodes had aired, this was due to the poor ratings obtained. A fan-led campaign caused NBC to broadcast three more episodes in July 2000, but these would not be seen until September of that year when the cable channel Fox Family aired them in syndication.",
